# SVG Path Shaper

You're go-to tool for exploring and modifying SVG path data. Enjoy!

## Using this tool, you can:
- explore / learn about SVG paths
- tweak: by directly changing path data
- tweak: by click-and-drag of the visualized path
- save: quickly copy your tweaked path data 
- use: as a stroke, as a crop-path, as an animation path, etc.
- preview transform animations from original path to the tweaked version

## This is a currently in MVP phase
Some enhancements for the future include:
- handle input of multiple paths
- resize the path data to the size of the canvas (instead of 'scale' up and down buttons)
